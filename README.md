# Vehicle Factory Factory

Create "factory factory" function that returns a constructor function.

The factory factory takes in one parameter, "type".

Each created factory needs to create objects with this given type.

Each created factory needs to take in three parameters and save them to the created objects:
- make
- model

Use your factory factory to create at least five factories, such as
- bicycle factory
- car factory
- boat factory
- blimp factory
- train factory

Lastly, use those factories to create some vehicles.

Store all your created vehicles inside one array, loop over that array and print out each vehicle.

Question: Check the *type* of your factories and of the objects that your factories create - what is the type of a factory and what is the type of a created object? Add your answer as comments into into your solution file.
